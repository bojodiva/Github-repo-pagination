## Github Repo pagination project

My name is Ojo Abisola Deborah.

I am a student at AltSchool Africa.

My Repos App (https://endearing-cupcake-266e60.netlify.app/) is my AltSchool Africa second semester exam project.

It is an app that fetches my repositories from github and displays it for people to check out the repositories I have been working on so far.

I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Had an awesome experience building this app, I hope it was helpful :).
